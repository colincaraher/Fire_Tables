Fire Tables

Fire Tables is a graphical user interface for managing iptables firewall rules in Linux. The interface is python scripted, using Tkinter to set up a system of grid tables. It allows the user to easily set, show, remove, or flush rules with real time feedback from the terminal as rules are edited.
